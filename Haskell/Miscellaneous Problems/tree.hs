-- write a Haskell function \texttt{insert} to insert an element into a tree.
-- Recall that in a BST, every element appearing in the first (left) subtree
-- of a node must be smaller than the element of that node, and every element
-- in the second (right) subtree must be larger.
-- Note that this tree type does not have values, just keys. Include a type
-- declaration for your \texttt{insert} function.
-- You may use any function in the Haskell prelude, but not functions
-- defined in libraries.
